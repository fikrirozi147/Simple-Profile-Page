In this application, I've done:

1. A StatefulWidget called ProfilePage for the main screen of the application.
2. Add a TextField widget for the user to input their name. Use a TextEditingController to capture the input value.
3. Add a second TextField widget for the user to input their age. Set the keyboardType to TextInputType.number and use another TextEditingController to capture the input value.
4. I use ElevatedButton to allow the user to upload a profile picture.
5. When the button is pressed, I use image_picker to open the device's image gallery and select an image. Store the selected image in the state.
6. I Use an Image widget to display the selected profile picture. If no picture is selected, show a default placeholder image.
7. I use ElevatedButton for the "Submit" button below the input fields. When pressed, update the state to display the entered name, age, and profile picture below the button.
8. I use a Text widget to display the user's entered name and age.
9. I choose purple color theme for the app.
